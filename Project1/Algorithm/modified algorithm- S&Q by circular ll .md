## Algorithm

1. Start the program.

2. Define a node structure containing:
   - Data to store the value.
   - Next pointer to store the address of the next node.

3. Initialize the pointers:
   - Stack: top = NULL.
   - Queue: rear = NULL.

4. Display a menu allowing the user to select Stack or Queue operations.

5. Perform Stack Operations (LIFO):
   - Push: Create a new node and insert it at the beginning of the circular linked list. Update the top pointer.
   - Pop: Check for underflow, delete the top node and update the circular link.
   - Display: Traverse from top until the starting node is reached again and display all elements.

6. Perform Queue Operations (FIFO):
   - Enqueue: Create a new node and insert it at the rear of the circular linked list. Update the rear pointer.
   - Dequeue: Check for underflow and delete the front node (rear->next).
   - Display: Traverse from front to rear and display all elements.

7. Maintain circular connections:
   - Ensure the last node points back to the first node.
   - Update the next pointers after every insertion and deletion.

8. Handle special conditions:
   - Display an appropriate message if the stack or queue is empty.
   - Set the respective pointer to NULL when the last node is deleted.

9. Repeat the operations according to the user's choice until Exit is selected.

10. Stop the program.
